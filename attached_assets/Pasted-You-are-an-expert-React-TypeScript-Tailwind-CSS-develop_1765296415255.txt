You are an expert React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS developer.

Goal:  
Build a **fully responsive, production-ready academic research group website** for  
**“SWING @ IIIT Kottayam – Smart Wireless Inter-Networking Research Group”**, based on the detailed spec below.

Tech stack (please set up the project for me):

- React + TypeScript (Vite or Create React App, your choice)
- React Router for page navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling (configured and working)
- React Icons (for section icons and social icons)
- Folder for static assets: `/public/images/...`

Overall requirements:

- Clean, modern, **dark theme** UI similar to a professional research-lab site.
- Color scheme:
  - Primary: teal/blue gradient (#088f8f, #54b3d6)
  - Secondary: white + gray tones
  - Accent: soft pastel colors for cards
- **Mobile-first, fully responsive**: works well on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- Smooth scrolling to sections, subtle hover effects and transitions.
- Components must be reusable and data-driven (map over arrays instead of repeating markup).
- Put all major text content into separate data files (e.g. `data/research.ts`, `data/events.ts`) to make it easy to update.

ROUTING & PAGES
Create these routes with React Router:

GLOBAL LAYOUT & COMPONENTS

Create these shared components:

- `components/Layout.tsx`
  - Includes top navigation bar and footer.
  - Wrap all pages.

- `components/Navbar.tsx`
  - Sticky top navbar.
  - Dual logo (IIIT + SWING) on the left.
  - Navigation links to all pages (Home, Research Areas, Projects, Events, Research Output, Team, Gallery, Downloads, Publications, About, Contact).
  - Hamburger menu for mobile with slide-down menu.

- `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Contact info summary
  - Quick links
  - Social media icons (Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, GitHub – use placeholder URLs).

- `components/SectionHeader.tsx`
  - Title + subtitle + small icon.

- `components/Card.tsx`
  - Generic card with title, description, optional icon, and optional badge.

- `components/Timeline.tsx`
  - For events page.

- `components/GalleryGrid.tsx`
  - For responsive gallery.

- `components/StatsStrip.tsx`
  - For showing count of students, projects, patents, etc.

DESIGN & UX DETAILS

- Use Tailwind utilities for spacing, typography, and layout.
- Use `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4` or similar to center content.
- Headings: use Google Fonts style equivalent (Montserrat / Lato via CSS or default Tailwind fonts).
- Add hover transitions for cards and buttons.
- Use gradients in hero background and primary buttons.
- Ensure good contrast and accessibility (ARIA labels, alt text for images, semantic HTML).

DATA ORGANIZATION

Create a `/src/data` folder with structured TypeScript data:

- `researchAreas.ts`
- `team.ts`
- `projects.ts`
- `events.ts`
- `researchOutput.ts`
- `highlights.ts`
- `gallery.ts`
- `links.ts`

Each file should export typed arrays used by the components. This keeps components clean and reusable.

DELIVERABLE

1. Full React + TypeScript + Tailwind project structure, ready to run with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
2. All routes and components implemented as described.
3. Sample placeholder images and links so I can later replace them with real assets.
4. Clear comments where I need to plug in my own images (faculty photos, event images, logos, PDFs, etc.).
